// These program might not execute it is just example

// child objects must adhere to the behavior and expectations defined by their parent class.
// A parent class reference can hold an object of a child class without altering the expected behavior.
// Eg - LSP says: Anywhere you can use a parent class (Payment), you should also be able to use any of its child classes (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, etc.) without breaking the program.
// One of the classic examples of this principle is a rectangle having four sides. A rectangleâ€™s height can be any value and width can be any value. A square is a rectangle with equal width and height. So we can say that we can extend the properties of the rectangle class into square class.
